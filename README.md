  # Challenges 3 & 4:
Challenge 3: The custom behavior implemted for NPCs involves allowing the NPCs to switch weapons depending on the distance to a player (long distance and short distance) as well as heading over to the healing zone if their health drops below 50% and the enemy target (player) is not close to them

Challenge 4: For this Challenge, a small game was created that involves prison escape rouge like level where players have to fight against NPCs whilst protecting their guide who will help them escape. Players have to get through all 4 stages of the prison before getting to the ship and escaping to win the game. The guide NPC will in some cases play a dialog audio for which IEleven Labs was utilized to make custom AI dialogues.
